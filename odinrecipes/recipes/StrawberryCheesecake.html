        <ul>
            <li>1 ¼ cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
            <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h8>
            Filling:
        </h8>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (10 ounce) packages frozen sweetened sliced strawberries, thawed and drained</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>
            Directions
        </h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Make crust: Combine graham cracker crumbs, butter, sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl; mix well. Press onto the bottom of an ungreased 9-inch springform pan. Place in the refrigerator to chill for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Make filling: Place strawberries and cornstarch into a blender. Cover and puree until smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour strawberry sauce into a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil and stir until sauce is thick and shiny, about 2 minutes. Set aside 1/3 cup strawberry sauce; cool. Cover and refrigerate remaining sauce for serving.</li>
            <li>Beat cream cheese in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; gradually beat in condensed milk. Mix in lemon juice and vanilla extract, then beat in eggs on low speed until just combined.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/2 of the cream cheese mixture over crust; drop 1/2 of the reserved strawberry sauce by 1/2 teaspoonfuls on cream cheese layer. Carefully spoon remaining cream cheese mixture over sauce; drop remaining strawberry sauce by 1/2 teaspoonfuls on top. Cut through the top layer only with a knife to swirl strawberry sauce.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the center is almost set, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around the edge of the pan to loosen; cool for 1 hour at room temperature. Refrigerate at least 4 hours to overnight before serving.</li>
            <li>Serve reserved strawberry sauce with cheesecake. If sauce is too thick, stir in water.</li>

        </ul>
